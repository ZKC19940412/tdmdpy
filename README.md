TDMDpy: A python package to calculate thermodynamic quantities for water/ice systems from MD simulations.

### Feautres
* Orthobaric densities
* Radial distribution functinos
* Self diffusion coefficients
* Enthalpy of vaporization
* Vibrational density of states

### Advanced Features
* Single-point energy and force predictions with ML potentials, using [pyNEP](https://github.com/bigd4/PyNEP)
* Normal mode analysis for single water molecule in gas-phase, using [kALDo](https://github.com/nanotheorygroup/kaldo)
* Create systems of hydrogen-disordered ice structures, using [genice2](https://github.com/vitroid/GenIce)

### Disclaimers
* Examples highlighting usage of TDMDpy will be acessible in a spearate repo as relevant publication is avialable. 
* TDMDpy is currently developed for linux machine only, and might be made to compatiable with Windows later.
